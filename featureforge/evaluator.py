    #     - When evaluating the first N data-points, if there's an error with a
    #       feature, that feature is automatically excluded (strict mode).
    #     - If error occurs on later data-points and FEATURE_MAX_ERRORS_ALLOWED
    #       was exceeded for that feature, the feature is discarded. If not
    #       exceeded, an internal counter will be increated for that feature.

    #      - every sampled that was discarded because of this feature,
    #        is re-considered.
    #      - every previously evaluated sample is stripped off of the result
